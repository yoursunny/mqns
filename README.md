# Dynamic-QNetSim

![Lint](https://github.com/amar-ox/dynamic-qnetsim/actions/workflows/lint.yml/badge.svg)

## Overview

**Dynamic-QNetSim** is a quantum network simulator designed to streamline the comparative evaluation of entanglement routing under dynamic and heterogeneous network conditions. It addresses the need for a unified, flexible framework for rapidly prototyping and benchmarking a wide range of entanglement distribution strategies and quantum network architectures. The simulator supports systematic exploration of routing algorithms, swapping strategies, purification schedules, and resource management techniques across diverse network scenarios.

This project is part of an ongoing research effort to evaluate the quantum networking approaches presented in our recent survey:
🔗 [Entanglement Routing in Quantum Networks: A Comprehensive Survey](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/10882978)

> ⚠️ This is an active research and development project. Functionality and APIs are evolving.

## Based on SimQN

Dynamic-QNetSim reuses components from [SimQN v0.1.5](https://github.com/qnslab/SimQN), which is licensed under the GNU General Public License v3.0.

This is *not* a fork of the official SimQN repository, but rather a standalone project that incorporates a snapshot of SimQN's implementation—specifically the discrete-event simulation engine, noise modeling framework, and code structure. Substantial modifications have been made to support dynamic routing protocols and enhanced entanglement management capabilities.

This project is therefore licensed under the GPLv3. See the LICENSE file for details.

While we are developing dedicated documentation tailored to this simulator, users can refer to [SimQN’s documentation](https://qnlab-ustc.github.io/SimQN/) in the meantime to understand the foundational models and architecture.

## Installation

This is a development version to be installed from source.

First, clone the repository:

```bash
git checkout https://github.com/amar-ox/dynamic-qnetsim.git
cd dynamic-qnetsim
```

(Optional but recommended) Create a virtual environment:

```bash
python3 -m venv simqn
source simqn/bin/activate
```

**Option 1: Install from wheel (local build)**

```bash
pip3 install setuptools wheel
python3 setup.py bdist_wheel
pip3 install --force-reinstall dist/qns-0.1.5-py3-none-any.whl
```

**Option 2: Install in editable mode**

```bash
pip3 install -e .
```

## Example: Three-Node Simulation

The repository includes a simple example (`examples/3_nodes_thruput.py`) simulating end-to-end entanglement throughput between three nodes connected in a linear topology.

This demonstrates:

* Entanglement generation over lossy fiber
* Swapping operations at the intermediate node
* Performance monitoring of entanglement attempts and success rates

You can run the example with:

```bash
python3 examples/3_nodes_thruput.py > output.log
```

More examples and configuration options will be added as the simulator evolves.
