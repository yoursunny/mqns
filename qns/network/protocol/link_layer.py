            packet (RecvClassicPacket): The packet containing the control message and associated classical channel.

        Raises:
            Exception: If no corresponding quantum channel exists between the current node and the sender.

        Notes:
            - The `key` uniquely identifies a reservation and is used to properly store the generated EPR.
            - This method is used everytime an initialor node wants to generate a new entanglement.
            - FIFO buffering allows for deferred reservation attempts when memory is temporarily unavailable.
