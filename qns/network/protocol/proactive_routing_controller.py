        It currently supports linear chain topology with a single S-D path.
        It computes a path between S and D and installs instructions with a predefined swapping order.

        This method performs the following:
            - Builds the network route table.
            - Locates the source ("S") and destination ("D") nodes in the network.
            - Computes shortest path between source and destination.
            DijkstraRouteAlgorithm is the default algorithm and uses hop counts at metric.
            - Verifies that the number of nodes in the computed path matches the expected number
            of swapping steps based on the configured swapping strategy.
            - Constructs per-channel memory allocation vectors (m_v) assuming buffer-space multiplexing
            defined by the memory capacity of node S.
            - Sends installation instructions to each node along the path using classical channels.

        Raises:
            RuntimeError - no route from S to D.
            ValueError - computed route length does not match swapping order vector.

        Notes:
            - `self.swapping_order` provides the expected swapping instructions.
            - Multiplexing strategy is hardcoded as "B" (buffer-space).
            - Path instructions are transmitted over classical channels using the `"install_path"` command.
            - This method is primarily intended for test or static configuration scenarios, not dynamic routing.
            - Purification scheme has to be specified (hardcoded) in the function.
