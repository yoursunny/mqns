              This enforces recurrence purification protocols, which require
        both qubits to have undergone the same number of purification rounds.

            qchannel (str): The name of the quantum channel used by the current qubit for entanglement.
            path_id (Optional[int]): The path ID that eligible qubits must match. If None, any path ID is accepted.
            purif_rounds (int): The number of purification rounds the eligible qubit must have undergone.

        Returns:
            List[Tuple[MemoryQubit, QuantumModel]]:
                A list of eligible qubits (along with their associated quantum models) that match the criteria.
