class ProactiveRoutingController(RoutingController):
    """
    Centralized control plane for proactive routing.
    Works with ``ProactiveForwarder`` on quantum nodes.

    This controller is compatible with both ASYNC and SYNC timing modes.
    It can automatically pick up requests added through ``QuantumNetwork``.

    **Resource Admission and Blocking Policy**

    When the network uses buffer-space multiplexing scheme, the controller tracks available qubit
    resources on each node, and only accepts a request if it does not cause a resource violation.
    If a request cannot be accepted immediately due to lack of resources:

    * The controller, by default, rejects the request.
    * If ``drq_cap`` is set to a positive integer, up to ``drq_cap`` requests may be placed in
      a *deferred request queue*. Whenever a previous request is finished, the controller checks
      whether the newly available resources would allow some deferred requests can be accepted.

    The ``RoutingPath`` in a request may compute multiple possible paths and its ``multipath`` attribute
    indicates whether the resource demands are additive or alternative:

    * For ``multipath="all"``, the request must use all paths concurrently.
      The controller may accept the request only if there are sufficient resources for all computed paths.
    * For ``multipath="any"``, the request only uses one path.
      The controller chooses the first path for which there are sufficient resources, and ignores other paths.
      In other words, if the primary path has insufficient resources, the request could be rerouted onto a secondary path.
